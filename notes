Sometimes, there will be small changes to a version, like spelling fixes, etc.
Simply put; Small changes that don't pile up or change enough, to release a whole new version.
Once a version is working, it gets merged to main, for spelling fixes, etc.
Then, it is finalized, and a new version is made.
This process repeats.

Hey! For those of you who clone this project, I thank you very much!
Ever since pyTGM, as long as updates occurr, it stays relevant.
I would appreciate it if you could donate:

Even just a dollar helps. Every proejct I make, I ignite, and then let the community continue the updates.
This hasn't worked yet, so I would appreciate even a feature request, to increase engagement,
so I have a reason to continue. The more engagement, the more updates I will release.
