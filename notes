Sometimes, there will be small changes to a version, like spelling fixes, etc.
Simply put; Small changes that don't pile up or change enough, to release a whole new version.
Once a version is working, it gets merged to main, for spelling fixes, etc.
Then, it is finalized, and main is merged to that version, and a new version is made.
This process repeats.
