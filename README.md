<h2>Set Up</h2>
You need a JDK, when making it, I used openJDK<br>
You also need the Java lang installed.<br>

Then, run `javac potater.java`, with whatever params you want!

There are attack types and targets.

## Use
<img align='right' src='imgs/ver/v0.2.0.png' width='25%'>
The targets are <code>Custom</code>, <code>Self</code>, <code>WiFi</code><br>
Custom defaults at 192.168.1.1, to prevent overloading anything, the data is instantly denied.<br>
Self is ::1, the IPv6 of 127.0.0.1<br>
And WiFi gets the IP of the WiFi, and selects the first one.
